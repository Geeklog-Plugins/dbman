##### /CAUTION #####

INSTALL:

Step 1:  Uncompress the Yabackup plugin archive while in the <geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will
create a directory called Yabackup in the plugins directory.

Step 2:  Create the admin directory.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called yabackup.

Step 3:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/Yabackup/ directory.  Copy the files in the admin directory 
to the admin/plugins/Yabackup/ directory your created in step 2.

Step 4:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and run install.php in your admin/plugins/yabackup/ directory.
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not examine Geeklog system errorlog
for possible problems.

The Yabackup plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the Yabackup Icon will
take you to the admin page.  

Step 5: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to Yabackup administration and Viewing.  
You can delegate control for either of these functions through the user and group editors.

UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Run the install.php page in your admin/plugins/yabackup directory.  This will remove
 all the data concerned with Yabackup plugin from your database.

Step 2:  Delete the two plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/Yabackup/ 
and <admin>/plugins/Yabackup/

That's it.
