Install/Uninstall instruction for the Geeklog DBMan (Database Manager) plugin.

BEFORE INSTALL:

#####  WARNING #####

This plugin is still at its alpha release stage, so I'm afraid it might have some
bugs.  Make a backup of your current geeklog database using the built-in admin
feature in advance.  Verify your backup feature is configured correctly and backup
file is not 0 byte (This is worth a check).  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

##### /WARNING #####

INSTALL:

Step 1:  Uncompress the DBMan plugin archive (dbman-x.y.tar.gz) while in the
<geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will create a directory named
 dbman in the plugins directory.

Step 2:  Create the admin directory.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create
a directory named dbman.  DBMan doesn't need a 'public_html/dbman' directory.

Step 3:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/dbman/admin directory.  Copy the files
in the directory to the admin/plugins/dbman/ directory your created in step 2.

Step 4:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user (admin) and install dbman plugin
in the plugin editor.  The install page will tell you if the install was successful
or not.  If not, examine Geeklog system errorlog for possible problems.

The DBMan plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the DBMan
Icon will take you to the admin page.

Step 5: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to DBMan
administration and Viewing.  You can delegate control for either of these functions
through the user and group editors.

UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user (admin).  Uninstall dbman plugin
in the plugin editor.

Step 2:  Delete the two plugin directories created in the install process:
<geeklog-dir>plugins/dbman/ and <admin>/plugins/dbman/

That's it.
